SIMP_NEW.FOR has been updated this morning with a new FORMAT statement to 
allow me to utilize the RESTART capabilities.  It is saved on the V.P. Model
Work disk in the PROGRAMS directory.

The *.DAT files with cas# labels may have either a 'p2' pr 'p3' designation
corresponding to 2 parameter(A, B) or 3 parameter (A, B, C).
