Information Flow Diagram

Description of StEPP
- Deficiencies
  - Not flexible enough to easily add new properties
  - Cannot easily be converted to ActiveX DLL
- Positive Traits
  - UNIFAC calculation system
  - Well-tested and verified

Description of PPMS/PEARLS/PDE
- Deficiencies
  - Not flexible enough to easily add new properties
  - Cannot easily be converted to ActiveX DLL
  - Many unit conversion errors, e.g.:
    - Density of toluene = 104 g/cm^3
    - Density of water = -8.73e+04 kmol/m^3
    - Density of toluene = -8.50e+07 kg/m^3
- Positive Traits
  - Very large databases (DIPPR801 and DIPPR911)
  - Good prototype

Actions Required to Merge StEPP and PPMS
- Phase One
  - Finalize StEPP/PPMS agreement (starting today)
  - Add a few more unit conversions
  - Add more estimation techniques
- Phase Two
  - Add printing, exporting, searching
  - Add UNIFAC calculations
  - Link with EFRAT and SCENE
- Phase Three
  - Develop SMILES-based QSAR/QSPR estimation techniques
  - Link with Jane's model
