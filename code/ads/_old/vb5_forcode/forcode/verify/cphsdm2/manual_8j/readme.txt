NOTE ABOUT CPHSDM2 VERIFICATIONS.
=================================

The VB3 version of AdDesignS (pre-dating 9/3/98) includes a
link to a DLL that contains the CPM() subroutine.  The VB5
version of AdDesignS (as of 9/3/98) includes a link to
an EXE that contains the CPM() subroutine.  (Apparently
EXEs are more stable, but they are definitely easier to
debug.)

The files in this directory are:

    CPM_VB3.DAT   -   Test file in AdDesignS-VB3 format
    CPM_VB5.DAT   -   Test file in AdDesignS-VB5 format
    CPM_VB3.TXT   -   C/Co-vs-time output from AdDesignS-VB3
    CPM_VB5.TXT   -   C/Co-vs-time output from AdDesignS-VB5

Both versions of the program produce the same C/Co-vs-time output.
Note that the component "TRICHLOROETHYLENE" was the one used
in each of the CPHSDM model runs.
