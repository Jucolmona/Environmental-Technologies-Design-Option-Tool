NOTE ABOUT IPES3 VERIFICATIONS.
===============================

The VB3 version of AdDesignS (pre-dating 9/3/98) includes a
link to a DLL that contains the SPEQ() subroutine.  The VB5
version of AdDesignS (as of 9/3/98) includes a link to
an EXE that contains the SPEQ() subroutine.  (Apparently
EXEs are more stable, but they are definitely easier to
debug.)

The files in this directory are:

    SPEQ_VB3.DAT   -   Test file in AdDesignS-VB3 format
    SPEQ_VB5.DAT   -   Test file in AdDesignS-VB5 format

Both versions of the program produce the same K and 1/n:

    K = 2686.01 (mg/g)*(L/mg)^(1/n)
    1/n = 0.355327
