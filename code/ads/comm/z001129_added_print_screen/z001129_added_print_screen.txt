- All development code prior to these changes for ADS is in 
	X:\_backups\z001129_ads\ads_old.zip

- Added a command button to most screens to enable the user to print the screen 
	to printer.  I added a module to the app called PrintScreen.bas that 
	contains code I found using the Microsoft Support KnowledgeBase. 
	(www.microsoft.com, choose the support tab, then go to the Searchable
	KnowledgeBase).  I searched for any articles containing 'Print Screen' with 
	Visual Basic as the product.

	This code contains other tools that could be used for related purposes
	in other apps, so it has been also added to the generic app.

	To use this module, the OLE Automation object must be added:  
	Go to Project, References and click on OLE Automation.

- Copied new executable to ..programs so Tech personnel could use ETDOT Update, 
	then I renamed it in x:\etdot10\code\ads\vb6 to ads_new.exe.
	I then copied the old ads.exe from backup into the development directory
	as ads_old.exe and into ..programs as ads.exe so that any InstallShield 
	compiles would contain the old code.
