Subject: Re: bug in AdOx 

Dave,

I finished the revision and tested the results are correct.  The files are in the folder G:\luke\Z020627_Modified_Luke   The Fortran source files and the executable are in this folder.

Since I didn't know how to generate the .dsp .dsw .ncb .opt and .plg  files, I didn't update the folder G:\luke\adox_for\forcode\z020627_modified_by_luke (main code) 

I also revised the manual accordingly. The revision includes the paragraph about TIC conversion and some equation number formats.  

Please let me know if you have any questions.
