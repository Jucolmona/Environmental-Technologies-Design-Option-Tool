DESCRIPTION: Batch reactor prediction.

SUMMARY:

I recompiled Shumin's FORTRAN EXE file for case 980702a.
Note that for case 980701b, I just used Shumin's FORTRAN
EXE as she had provided it to me.  The same deviations
were present between my results and Shumin's results
(ejorun_*_model.out and shuminrun_model.out).  However,
both of my model runs (ejorun_*_model.out) are identical
to one another.  Therefore, my conclusion is that my
compilation using PowerStation is identical to Shumin's
compilation.

ejorun_980701b_model.out -- My output for case "980701b".
ejorun_980702a_model.out -- My output for case "980702a".
shuminrun_model.out -- Shumin's output.
