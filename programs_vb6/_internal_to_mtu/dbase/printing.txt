1. Potential Print Formatting Problems

The manuals are available in Word 97 format. Please
be aware that the authors have observed formatting 
changes when printing these Word files on different 
printers. It is not unexpected that a user printing 
the Word files may not achieve a printed version of 
the manual that agrees completely with the page 
numbering shown in the Table of Contents.


2. Obtaining Printed Copies of the Manuals
   from CenCITT

CenCITT will send licensed users of the software 
a printed copy of the manuals for a fee. To request 
information about obtaining a printed copy of 
any or all manuals, please contact:

3. AdDesignS Manual Printing Instructions

Note: Microsoft Word 97 or Microsoft Word 97 Viewer must 
      be installed in order to print the Word version of 
      the manual. If neither Word 97 nor Word 97 Viewer 
      is installed on your system, Microsoft Word 97
      Viewer must be installed as described in step 6 
      below before continuing.

Load the file "ads.doc" within the ..\etdot10\ads\help 
folder (or whatever folder into which the ETDOT software
was installed) into Word 97 (or Word 97 Viewer) and 
choose "Print" from the "File" menu.


4. ASAP Manual Printing Instructions

Note: Microsoft Word 97 or Microsoft Word 97 Viewer must 
      be installed in order to print the Word version of 
      the manual. If neither Word 97 nor Word 97 Viewer 
      is installed on your system, Microsoft Word 97
      Viewer must be installed as described in step 6 
      below before continuing.

The ASAP manual consists of 26 files named asap_01.doc,
asap_02.doc, asap_03.doc, ..., asap_25.doc, asap_26.doc
(see "README.doc" within the ..\etdot10\asap\help folder
for a complete listing of files and the page numbers 
in the manual represented by each). To print the ASAP 
manual in Word 97 format, it is necessary to print 
all 26 files.

Load the file "asap_01.doc" within the ..\etdot10\asap\help 
folder (or whatever folder into which the ETDOT software
was installed) into Word 97 (or Word 97 Viewer) and 
choose "Print" from the "File" menu. Repeat the process 
for "asap_02.doc", "asap_03.doc", ..., "asap_26.doc".


5. StEPP Manual Printing Instructions

Note: Microsoft Word 97 or Microsoft Word 97 Viewer must 
      be installed in order to print the Word version of 
      the manual. If neither Word 97 nor Word 97 Viewer 
      is installed on your system, Microsoft Word 97
      Viewer must be installed as described in step 6 
      below before continuing.

Load the file "stepp.doc" within the ..\etdot10\stepp\help 
folder (or whatever folder into which the ETDOT software
was installed) into Word 97 (or Word 97 Viewer) and 
choose "Print" from the "File" menu.


6. Installing Microsoft Word 97 Viewer

The Microsoft Word 97 version of the manual files
requires that either Microsoft Word 97 (or later
version) or Microsoft Word 97 Viewer be installed
in order to print properly.  If you do not have  
Microsoft Word 97 installed on your PC, Microsoft
Word 97 Viewer is provided on the install CD. This
software will allow you to print the Word files that
make up the manuals.
   
To install the Microsoft Word 97 Viewer, re-insert 
the "ETDOT Programs" CD-ROM into your drive and run 
"z:\wd97vwr32.exe" where "z:" is the letter 
associated with your CD-ROM drive.  Follow the 
instructions provided by the Microsoft Word 97 Viewer
installation  software.  Sometimes, a reboot is 
required to complete the install process; if the 
software prompts you to reboot your computer, do so.
