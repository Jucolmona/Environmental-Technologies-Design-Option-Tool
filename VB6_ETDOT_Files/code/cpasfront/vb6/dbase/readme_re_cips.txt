                            STATUS OF CIPS
                  "Chemical Industry Planning System"


The current version of CIPS is a Microsoft Access 2.0 program.
Unfortunately, CIPS cannot be loaded using more recent versions of
Access, including Microsoft Access 97 or Microsoft Access 2000,
due to version incompatibilities.

We are currently in the process of rewriting CIPS as a Visual
Basic 6.0 program.
