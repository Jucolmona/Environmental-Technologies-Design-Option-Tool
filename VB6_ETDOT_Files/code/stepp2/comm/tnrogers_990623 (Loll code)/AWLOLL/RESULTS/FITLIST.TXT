Current Programs:

FIT_34.FOR - 2 loop simplex/linear reference model for entire fitting set
FIT_6.FOR - 2 loop simplex/linear reference model for 8 chemical test set
FIT1-14.FOR - All other models should use this version since it is verified
FITS_6.FOR - Simplex only fitting B values reference model for 8 chemical
             test set
PREDREF.FOR - Runs predictions for the reference substance models only.
              (Use FIT1-14.FOR with MFIT=6 for all others).
FIT_6a.FOR - 2 loop simplex/linear reference model for 8 chemical test set
             with the seeding block in a subroutine (SEEDIT). Otherwise, the
             same as FIT_6.FOR
