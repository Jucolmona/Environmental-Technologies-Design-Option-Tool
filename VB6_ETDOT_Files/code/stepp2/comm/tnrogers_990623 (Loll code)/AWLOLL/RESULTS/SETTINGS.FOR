C      INTEGER MFIT,CFIT,FTYPE,MTYPE,RTYPE

C  MFIT DETERMINES WHICH DATA SET TO READ FROM.  
C  MFIT = 1, READ FROM SINGLE.DAT(INDIVIDUAL CAS #S)
C  MFIT = 2, READ FROM FAMGROUP.DAT(CHEMICAL FAMILIES)
C  MFIT = 3, READ FROM FRAGMENT.DAT(ALL THE CHEMICALS WITH FRAGMENT i)
C  MFIT = 4, OPTIMIZE CHEMICAL SPECIFIC A,B, AND C PARAMETERS.  READ
C            SEED VALUES FROM TSEED324.D (CFIT MUST = 0)
C  MFIT = 6, RUN THE MODEL TO GENERATE V.P.s USING SUPPLIED FRAGMENT       
C            INPUTS
C  CFIT DETERMINES IF THE FAMILY GROUP C CONSTANT IS TO BE FIT
C  CFIT = 0, NO C CONSTANT FIT
C  CFIT = 1, FIT THE C CONSTANT FOR EACH FAMILY
C  FTYPE = 0, OPTIMIZE USING SIMPLEX
C  FTYPE = 1, SOLVE USING LINPAC (USE ONLY WITH MFIT=3)
C  FTYPE = 2, SOLVE USING LINPAC AND SIMPLEX (USE ONLY WITH MFIT=3)
C  MTYPE = 0, USE MODEL AS CODED IN VMODEL (USE WITH MFIT=6 OPTION)
C  MTYPE = 1, USE LINEAR MODEL (USE WITH MFIT=6 OPTION)
C  RTYPE = 0, USE ABSOLUTE APPROACH
C  RTYPE = 1, USE REFERENCE APPROACH
