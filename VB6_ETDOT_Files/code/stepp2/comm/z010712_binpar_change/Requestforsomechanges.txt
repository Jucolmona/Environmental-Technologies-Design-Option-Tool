Hello Dave,

There are a few more changes to be done in the DLL to load another binary
paramater file ( Global Data ). I installed fortran powerstaion but it seems
I have the old version ( version 4 1994-95) , I cant read ur project files
(dsp / dsw ), hence I think it will be best if you can re compile it with
your compiler.

The changes required are in the binpar file. I have edited the orig binpar
file ( from the updated DLL ) and am sending it across with this as file
name binpar_modified.f90. The lines which I have modified / added,  have my
comments as "modified by CB". All changes were done by Dr. Rogers and you
can review it if all is ok.

Thank you for your help.

Regards,
Chaitanya
