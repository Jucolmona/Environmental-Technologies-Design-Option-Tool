Meeting Issues for PEARLS Meeting (990518 @ 18:15)
======================================================

- Obtain verbal agreement points for use of PEARLS (renamed or not)
  within the SCENE software, and other ETDOT software


- An important topic is how we can supply DIPPR911 data (encapsulated
  into PEARLS) with SCENE or the ETDOT software; how much would this cost?
  Note we mostly want SMILES-based estimation techniques, because not
  every chemical out there will be in the DIPPR911 database anyway.


- Ensure everyone knows I plan to construct a paper agreement
  for us all to sign


- What is this window supposed to do: "Fitting and Units Conversion - 
  Antoine Coefficients"?  (frmantoine)
