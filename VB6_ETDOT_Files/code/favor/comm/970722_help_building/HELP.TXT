FaVOr consists of a graphical user interface (GUI), a FORTRAN program for calculating VOC concentrations and removal percentages, and a database and property estimation module that provide values of relevant parameters.    FaVOr is capable of simulating VOC fate with unit processes that are encountered in conventional wastewater treatment plants.  Calculations of VOC concentrations are determined by solution of mass balance equations for VOCs in the unit processes.  The unit processes simulated in FaVOr are shown in the Plant Schematic screen and are described in the Help available in the separate screens for the unit processes.  The mass balance equations include mechanisms for VOC biodegradation, sorption, volatilization and stripping, where applicable. These mechanisms also are described in the Help available in the separate screens for the unit processes.  The GUI provides a platform for the user to input wastewater treatment plant operating parameters and parameters relevant to  the physical, chemical and biological behavior of the VOCs.  The inputs consist of either default values, user-defined values, values obtained from built-in databases, or values supplied by a property estimation module (STEPP). The GUI provides a link to the parameter databases and to STEPP.    The GUI allows for execution of the FORTRAN program and for display of the program results in either a numerical or graphical format.  The GUI also provides for saving FaVOr setups and for printing numerical or graphical results.  Provision of these utilities may be found in the menu bars at the top of the relevant FaVOr screens.      \newpage  PLANT SCHEMATIC SCREEN  This screen contains the basic procedures for operating FaVOr. The procedures should be followed in this order:  1) Enter the plant influent flow rate and solids concentration.  2) Clicking on the ``Chemical Data and Environmental Conditions'' button brings the user to the Chemical Data and Environmental Conditions screen.  In this screen, the user can enter values, use default values, or use values supplied from a database, for chemical property, environmental, and general operational parameters.  3) Select the unit processes to be activated by clicking on the appropriate boxes will activate some of the unit processes (influent weir, aerated grit chamber, primary clarifier weir, and secondary clarifier weir).  Note that the remaining unit processes (primary clarifier, aeration basin, and secondary clarifier) are permanently activated.  4) Clicking on the icons for the unit processes in the plant schematic brings you to the screens for the respective unit processes.  These screens allow the user to activate the unit processes (except for the primary clarifier, aeration basin and secondary clarifier, which are permanently activated), specify operational and modeling conditions, and enter values for unit process operational and modeling parameters.  Default values are provided for each operational and modeling condition and parameter.    5) Clicking on the ``Execution'' button executes the model.  6) Clicking on the ``View Output'' button allows the user to view the model output--removal rates and concentrations--in numerical or graphical formats.  \underbar{General Description of VOC Modeling and Unit Processes}  VOCs are accounted for in each of three phases in FaVOr: liquid, solid, or gas. The wastewater entering the treatment plant is assumed to contain solid and liquid phases, unless the plant influent solids concentration is set to zero. It is assumed that the VOCs reach an instantaneous equilibrium between the liquid and solid phases in the influent and in all of the unit processes. Mass transfer-limited exchange is modeled for VOC liquid-gas exchanges.  FaVOr solves a mass balance equations for each unit process.  The mass balance equations account for interphase mass exchanges and biodegradation. Liquid-phase VOC biodegradation is modeled in the aeration basin.    Each type of unit process is treated as a reactor in series with the other unit processes.  Although the plant schematic displays only single unit processes in series, it is possible to model multiple unit processes in parallel (except for the influent weir).  In each unit process screen, the user can designate the number of unit process operating in parallel.  Each parallel unit process is assumed to be identical in terms of flow rates (liquid or gas),  geometry, {\it etc}. All unit processes except for the aeration basin are treated as single, completely stirred tank reactors (CSTRs).  The aeration basin can be modeled as a series of CSTRs. The grit chamber, clarifiers and aeration basin can be simulated as covered or uncovered reactors.  The weirs can be simulated only as open reactors.  Solids and liquid wastage in the clarifiers is accounted for in the mass balance equations.         \newpage  INFLUENT WEIR SCREEN  VOCs are removed from the influent weir (IW) by stripping as the wastewater falls from the top to the bottom of the weir.  Only one IW is allowed and the IW cannot be covered.  The user must specify the following parameters in the IW screen:  {\parindent = 20 pt  \item{-} whether the IW is active   \item{-} the model used to calculate the IW stripping removal rate: Pool or Nappe  \item{-} the width of the IW (the dimension of the weir transverse to the direction of flow)  \item{-} the distance from the liquid surface at the IW top to the liquid surface at the IW bottom   \item{-} the rate of gas flow leaving the tailwater of the IW (needed for the Pool Model)  }  The VOC is either assumed to be stripped into the air as the liquid flows over the drop, before it contacts the basin water surface, or stripped into the rising, entrained bubbles caused by the turbulence of the water flow entering the receiving basin.  Emission of contaminants at weirs can thus be modeled with two different models: the Pool Model (Baillod  {\it et al.}, 1991) and the Nappe Model (Pincince, 1991).  The Nappe Model assumes plug flow conditions for the liquid and completely mixed conditions for the gas.   All mass transfer is assumed to occur in the liquid stream as it falls to the surface and stripping caused by entrained bubbles in the receiving basin is ignored.  The rate of VOC stripping is related to the rate of oxygen stripping by a diffusivity relationship.  The oxygen stripping rates are calculated from fitted, empirical power law functions based on the width of the IW and the distance between top and bottom water levels.  The Pool Model assumes plug flow conditions for the gas, completely mixed conditions for the liquid, and considers mass transfer only into the entrained bubbles as they rise through the pool.  Stripping that occurs before the stream contacts the water surface is not considered.  The rate of VOC stripping for the Pool Model also is related to the rate of oxygen stripping by a diffusivity relationship.  The oxygen removal rate is determined by applying a mass balance to the rising bubble. The mass balance equation depends on the oxygen stripping rate, the Henry's law constants for the VOC and oxygen and the ratio of the IW liquid flow rate to the rate of gas flow leaving the tailwater of the IW. The oxygen stripping rates are calculated from fitted, empirical power law functions based on the width of the IW and the distance between top and bottom water levels (Nakasone, 1986).   \underbar{References}  Baillod, C.R., Crittenden, J.C., Mihelcic, J.R., Rogers, T.N., Grady, Jr., C.P.L. 1991.

WPCF}, 63:114-122.     \newpage  AERATED GRIT CHAMBER SCREEN  VOCs can be removed through two removal mechanisms in the aerated grit chamber (AGC): stripping and volatilization.  Although solids are wasted in AGCs, it assumed that VOCs do not sorb appreciably to these solids, and so sorption is neglected as a removal mechanism in FaVOr for AGCs.  It is also assumed that a negligible amount of liquid is wasted from the AGC.  The user must specify the following parameters in the AGC screen:  {\parindent = 20 pt  \item{-} whether the AGCs are active   \item{-} the number of parallel AGCs in use  \item{-} whether the AGCs are covered   \item{-} the ventilation rate for an AGC if the AGC is covered  \item{-} the liquid depth in an AGC  \item{-} the volume of an AGC  \item{-} the gas flow rate into an AGC   \item{-} the standard oxygen transfer efficiency (SOTR)  }  \underbar{Stripping}  Removal of VOCs by aeration in the AGC is simulated via the stripping mechanism.  Stripping in the AGC is occurs through air bubbles that are mechanical in origin.  The rate of VOC removal is given by (Roberts {\it et al.}, 1984) the product of gas flow rate ($Q_G$), the Henry's law constant ($H$), the VOC liquid-phase concentration ($C$), and a correction factor for the fraction of equilibrium achieved between VOC concentrations in the liquid and gas phases $(1 - e^{- \phi})$  \mb r_{strip} = Q_G H C \left( 1 - e^{- \phi} \right) \mef where $r_{strip}$ is the rate of stripping.  VOCs that have high values of the Henry's law constant may require significant tank depths to achieve equilibrium.  However, unless the Henry's constant is very large, the correction factor will be close to 1.  The correction factor is based on the overall VOC mass transfer coefficient, the gas flow rate, the aeration basin volume, and the Henry's law constant (Roberts {\it et al.}, 1984).    The overall VOC mass transfer coefficient is calculated by relating it to the overall mass transfer coefficient for oxygen (Munz and Roberts, 1989).  The overall mass transfer rate for oxygen is calculated from the standard oxygen transfer efficiency (SOTR), the AGC volume, and the dynamic saturation value for oxygen.  The overall oxygen mass transfer rate is adjusted to account for the effects of the wastewater matrix, the temperature, and a correction term (Baillod  {\it et al.}, 1986). The correction term is a function of the gas flow rate, temperature, volume of the basin, barometric pressure, effective depth, and other constants.  The effective depth is defined as the depth which the bubble concentration would be in equilibrium with the dissolved oxygen concentration at an infinite time during the unsteady state oxygen transfer test ($C_{\infty}^{\ast}$).  FaVOr estimates the effective depth in the AGC ($d_e$) as (from Baillod et al., 1986) $ d_e = 0.35 d $, where $d$ is the tank liquid depth.  $C_{\infty}^{\ast}$ is estimated from an expression found in Baillod {\it et al.} (1986).  It is a function of the effective depth;,barometric pressure, vapor pressure of water, a standard pressure of 101.33 kPa, specific weight of water, and saturation concentration of oxygen.  \underbar{Volatilization}  Volatilization occurs by way of air flow across the AGC surface. In an open basin, volatilization is induced by the wind, while in a closed basin volatilization is induced by forced air ventilation.  The rate of volatilization is based on a first-order rate expression where an overall mass transfer rate coefficient ($K_L a$) is multiplied by a VOC concentration driving force: \mb r_{vol} = K_L a ( C - C^{\ast} ) \mef where $r_{vol}$ is the rate of stripping, $C$ is the bulk VOC aqueous phase concentration, and $C^{\ast}$ is the VOC aqueous phase concentration that would be in equilibrium with the bulk air concentration.  The rate expression is based on the existence of a stagnant layer at the wastewater-air interface. When the reactor is uncovered, the air above the basin is assumed to have negligible VOC concentration and $C^{\ast} = 0$.  When the reactor is covered, a VOC gas phase mass balance equation that incorporates a ventilation rate is solved for the VOC gas phase concentration in the stagnant layer.    The overall mass transfer coefficient is based on the liquid and gas phase mass transfer coefficients and the Henry's law constant, assuming that liquid-phase mass transfer resistance is dominant.  The gas and liquid mass transfer coefficients are calculated either from correlations developed by Mackay and Yeun (1983) or by Govind {\it et al.} (1991) and Cohen {\it et al.} (1978). The Mackay and Yeun correlations depend on the wind speed, the gas and liquid phase Schmidt numbers, and the basin depth.  The Govind {\it et al.}/Cohen {\it et al.} correlation is based on a roughness Reynolds number, the VOC liquid diffusivity, VOC molecular weight, wind velocity, and the basin depth.  \underbar{References}  Baillod, C.R., Crittenden, J.C., Mihelcic, J.R., Rogers, T.N., Grady, Jr., C.P.L. 1991.

It is assumed that all solids entering the PCs are removed in the PC underflows.  The user must specify the following parameters in the PC screen:  {\parindent = 20 pt  \item{-} the number of parallel PCs in use  \item{-} the method used to calculate the volatilization overall mass transfer coefficient (note that the method used to calculate the volatilization overall mass transfer coefficient is set here for all of the unit processes)  \item{-} the method used to calculate the sorption partitioning coefficient (note that the method used to calculate the sorption partitioning coefficient is set here for all of the unit processes)  \item{-} whether the PCs are covered   \item{-} the ventilation rate for a PC if the PC is covered  \item{-} the liquid depth in a PC  \item{-} the volume of a PC  \item{-} the wastage flow rate from a PC   }  \underbar{Volatilization}  Volatilization occurs by way of air flow across the PC surface. In an open basin, volatilization is induced by the wind, while in a closed basin volatilization is induced by forced air ventilation.  The rate of volatilization is based on a first-order rate expression where an overall mass transfer rate coefficient ($K_L a$) is multiplied by a VOC concentration driving force: \mb r_{vol} = K_L a ( C - C^{\ast} ) \mef where $r_{vol}$ is the rate of stripping, $C$ is the bulk VOC aqueous phase concentration, and $C^{\ast}$ is the VOC aqueous phase concentration that would be in equilibrium with the bulk air concentration.  The rate expression is based on the existence of a stagnant layer at the wastewater-air interface. When the reactor is uncovered, the air above the basin is assumed to have negligible VOC concentration and $C^{\ast} = 0$.  When the reactor is covered, a VOC gas phase mass balance equation that incorporates a ventilation rate is solved for the VOC gas phase concentration in the stagnant layer.    The overall mass transfer coefficient is based on the liquid and gas phase mass transfer coefficients and the Henry's law constant, assuming that liquid-phase mass transfer resistance is dominant.  The gas and liquid mass transfer coefficients are calculated either from correlations developed by Mackay and Yeun (1983) or by Govind {\it et al.} (1991) and Cohen {\it et al.} (1978). The Mackay and Yeun correlations depend on the wind speed, the gas and liquid phase Schmidt numbers, and the basin depth.  The Govind {\it et al.}/Cohen {\it et al.} correlation is based on a roughness Reynolds number, the VOC liquid diffusivity, VOC molecular weight, wind velocity, and the basin depth.  \underbar{Wastage/Sorption}  VOCs are removed from the PCs in the underflow wastage in the liquid and solid phases.  The solids concentration in the PC underflow is calculated with a mass balance equation that depends on the influent solids concentration, influent flow rate into the PCs, and the PC wastage flow rate, assuming that the solids are completely removed in the PCs.    The rate of removal by VOC sorption to sludge ($r_{sorp}$) in the PCs is given as: \mb r_{sorp} = Q_w ( C + X_w q ) \mef where $Q_w$ is the volumetric wastage rate from the PC underflow, liter/day, $C$ is the bulk VOC aqueous phase concentration, $X_w$ is the fraction of biomass in the PC underflow wastage, mg/liter, and $q$ is the sludge phase concentration of chemical, mg/kg.  Sorption is modeled as an equilibrium process; thus, for low aqueous concentrations of VOCs in a wastestream a linear isotherm can describe the equilibrium sludge phase concentration of the chemical ($q$) with the equilibrium aqueous phase concentration ($C$): \mb q = K_p C \mef where $K_p$ is the chemical specific sludge-water partition coefficient normalized to organic matter (liter/gm VSS or liter/gm TS), and, $C$ is the equilibrium aqueous concentration of organic chemical, mg/liter.  It has been shown that $K_p$ can be estimated from a chemical's octanol-water partition coefficient ($K_{ow}$).  FaVOr allows a user to select either the correlation of Dobbs {\it et al.} (1989) \mb \log K_p \; \text{(liters/gm VSS)} = 0.58 \log K_{ow} + 1.14 \mef or that of Matter-M\"uller {\it et al.} (1980) \mb \log K_p \; \text{(liters/gm TS)} = 0.67 \log K_{ow} - 2.61 \mef FaVOr accounts for the different units of $K_p$ used in the two correlations.  The correlation of Dobbs {\it et al.} (1989) slightly overestimates sorption while that of Matter-M\"uller (1980) slightly under-predicts sorption (Baker, 1996).  \underbar{References}  Baker, A.L. 1996.

The number of active PCWs is equal to the number of primary clarifiers. The PCW cannot be covered.  The user must specify the following parameters in the PCW screen:  {\parindent = 20 pt  \item{-} whether the PCWs are active   \item{-} the model used to calculate the PCW stripping removal rates: Pool or Nappe  \item{-} the width of the PCWs (the circumference of the PCWs)  \item{-} the distance from the liquid surface at the PCW tops to the liquid surface at the PCW bottoms   \item{-} the rate of gas flow leaving the tailwater of the PCWs (needed for the Pool Model)  }  The VOC is either assumed to be stripped into the air as the liquid flows over the drop, before it contacts the basin water surface, or into the rising, entrained bubbles caused by the turbulence of the water flow entering the receiving basin.  Emission of contaminants at weirs can thus be modeled with two different models: the Pool Model (Baillod  {\it et al.}, 1991) and the Nappe Model (Pincince, 1991).  The Nappe Model assumes plug flow conditions for the liquid and completely mixed conditions for the gas.   All mass transfer is assumed to occur in the liquid stream as it falls to the surface and stripping caused by entrained bubbles in the receiving basin is ignored.  The rate of VOC stripping is related to the rate of oxygen stripping by a diffusivity relationship.  The oxygen stripping rates are calculated from fitted, empirical power law functions based on the width of the PCW and the distance between top and bottom water levels.  The Pool Model assumes plug flow conditions for the gas, completely mixed conditions for the liquid, and considers mass transfer only into the entrained bubbles as they rise through the pool.  Stripping that occurs before the stream contacts the water surface is not considered.  The rate of VOC stripping for the Pool Model also is related to the rate of oxygen stripping by a diffusivity relationship.

WPCF}, 63:114-122.     \newpage  AERATION BASIN SCREEN  In the aeration basins (ABs), three removal mechanisms are considered: biodegradation, stripping and volatilization.  Stripping can occur via either diffused bubble or surface aeration.  The VOC mass balance equations for the complete secondary system (AB and secondary clarifier, or SC) are solved simultaneously.  In the secondary system, solids and liquids are removed from the SC underflow and either recycled to the AB influent or wasted.  Solid and liquid recycle and wastage are included in the VOC mass balance equations.  The AB can be simulated as up to nine CSTRs in series, either to simulate a degree of plug flow or to simulate variable feed configurations.  Biomass concentrations are provided by solving substrate (BOD$_5$) and biomass mass balance equations in the secondary system.  Biomass concentrations are assumed to be equivalent to volatile suspended solids (VSS) concentrations.  Up to three screens are used to set the AB parameters: the Basic Aeration Basin screen, the CSTR Parameters screen, and the Biomass Calculations screen.  The Basic Aeration Basin screen allows the user to enter general AB parameters and specifications.  The CSTR Parameters screen is used only if the more than one CSTR is used to model the AB. In this screen, parameters are entered for each CSTR.  The Biomass Calculations screen is used if the user chooses to have FaVOr determine biomass concentrations in the AB, rather than entering these values by hand.  The user must specify the following parameters in the Basic Aeration Basin screen:  {\parindent = 20 pt  \item{-} the number of parallel ABs in use  \item{-} the type of aeration (diffused bubble aeration or surface aeration)   \item{-} whether the ABs are covered   \item{-} the ventilation rate for an AB if the AB is covered  \item{-} the liquid depth in an AB  \item{-} the wastage flow rate from a SC   \item{-} the recycle flow rate from a SC   \item{-} the standard oxygen transfer efficiency (SOTR)  \item{-} whether more than one CSTR is to be modeled. If the user chooses to model the AB as more than one CSTR, the CSTR Parameters screen will pop up and the user will be prompted to enter parameters related to the multiple CSTRs. Once the CSTR Parameters screen is completes, the user can return to the Basic Aeration Basin screen.  If the user chooses to model the AB as a single CSTR, the following parameters will be entered.  \item{-} the volume of the AB  \item{-} the gas flow rate for the AB  \item{-} whether (1) the user will enter or (2) FaVOr will calculate biomass concentrations in the AB. If the user chooses to have FaVOr calculate biomass concentrations, (1) the Biomass Calculations screen will pop up, (2) the user will be prompted to enter some parameters, (3) FaVOr will calculate the biomass concentrations, (4) the user will be returned to the Basic Aeration Basin screen, and (5) the calculated biomass concentration will appear on the Basic Aeration Basin screen.  The methods used by FaVOr to calculate biomass concentrations are described in the Help for the Biomass Calculations screen.  \item{-} the biomass concentration, if the user chooses to enter the biomass concentrations rather than have FaVOr calculate the biomass concentrations.   }  \underbar{Biodegradation}  The rate of removal or organic chemical due to biodegradation ($r_{bio}$) is described by \mb r_{bio} = K_b X C V \mef where $r_{bio}$ has units of $\mu$g/day, $C$ is the aqueous concentration of the chemical in the aeration basin ($\mu$g/liter), $V$ is the volume of the aeration basin(s) (liters), $X$ is the biomass concentration (mg VSS/liter) and $K_b$ is the biodegradation rate constant (liters/mg VSS-day).  $K_b$ equals the Monod kinetic terms ($\mu_{max} / K_s Y$) when the VOC concentration is much lower than the half saturation constant. This situation is true for most cases where the concentration of the individual organic chemical is in the ppb (not ppm) range.  The rate equation assumes that all of the biomass is involved in removing the chemical of interest.  However, some individuals suggest the quantity of microorganisms specifically degrading a target organic pollutant equals (COD of target chemical/COD of total wastestream) $\times$ MLVSS (or MLSS).  Also, little is currently known about biodegradation rates of organic chemicals in the complex mixture/ecology of an activated sludge process (Baillod {\it et al.}, 1991).  Ranges of $K_b$ are 0.0001 liters/mg VSS-day for a very nonbiodegradable chemical to 0.40 liters/mg VSS-day for a highly biodegradable chemical.  \underbar{Stripping - Surface Aeration}  The rate of stripping for surface aeration is based on a first-order rate expression where an overall mass transfer coefficient ($K_L a$) is multiplied by a VOC concentration driving force.   \mb r_{strip} = K_L a ( C - C^{\ast} ) \mef where $r_{strip}$ is the rate of stripping, $C$ is the bulk VOC aqueous phase concentration, and $C^{\ast}$ is the VOC aqueous phase concentration that would be in equilibrium with the bulk air concentration.  The rate expression is based on the existence of a stagnant layer at the wastewater-air interface. When the reactor is uncovered, the air above the basin is assumed to have negligible contaminant concentration.  When the reactor is covered, a gas phase mass balance equation that incorporates a ventilation rate is solved for the gas phase concentration in the stagnant layer.    The overall mass transfer coefficient for surface aeration is based on equations used to calculate mass transfer coefficients for oxygen.  The relationship developed by Munz and Roberts (1989) is used to determine VOC mass transfer coefficients from oxygen mass transfer coefficients, based on VOC and oxygen diffusivity ratios.  The  overall mass transfer rate for oxygen is calculated from the standard oxygen transfer efficiency (SOTR), the AB volume, and the dynamic saturation value for oxygen.  The overall oxygen mass transfer rate is adjusted to account for the effects of the wastewater matrix, the temperature, and a correction term (Baillod  {\it et al.}, 1986). The correction term is a function of the gas flow rate, temperature, volume of the basin, barometric pressure, effective depth, and other constants.  The effective depth is defined as the depth which the bubble concentration would be in equilibrium with the dissolved oxygen concentration at an infinite time during the unsteady state oxygen transfer test ($C_{\infty}^{\ast}$).  FaVOr estimates the effective depth for surface aeration in the AB ($d_e$) as (from Baillod et al., 1986) $ d_e = 0.07 d $ where $d$ is the tank liquid depth. $C_{\infty}^{\ast}$ is estimated from an expression found in Baillod {\it et al.} (1986).  It is a function of the effective depth;,barometric pressure, vapor pressure of water, a standard pressure of 101.33 kPa, specific weight of water, and saturation concentration of oxygen.   \underbar{Stripping - Diffused Bubble Aeration}  For diffused bubble aeration, the rate of VOC removal is given by (Roberts {\it et al.}, 1984) the product of gas flow rate ($Q_G$), the Henry's law constant ($H$), the VOC liquid-phase concentration ($C$), and a correction factor for the fraction of equilibrium achieved between VOC concentrations in the liquid and gas phases $(1 - e^{- \phi})$: \mb r_{strip} = Q_G H C \left( 1 - e^{- \phi} \right) \mef where $r_{strip}$ is the rate of stripping.  VOCs that have high values of the Henry's law constant may require significant tank depths to achieve equilibrium.  However, unless the Henry's constant is very large, the correction factor will be close to 1.  The correction factor is based on the overall VOC mass transfer coefficient, the gas flow rate, the aeration basin volume, and the Henry's law constant (Roberts {\it et al.}, 1984).    The overall VOC mass transfer coefficient is calculated by relating it to the overall mass transfer coefficient for oxygen (Munz and Roberts, 1989).  The overall mass transfer rate for oxygen is calculated from the standard oxygen transfer efficiency (SOTR), the AB volume, and the dynamic saturation value for oxygen.  The overall oxygen mass transfer rate is adjusted to account for the effects of the wastewater matrix, the temperature, and a correction term (Baillod  {\it et al.}, 1986). The correction term is a function of the gas flow rate, temperature, volume of the basin, barometric pressure, effective depth, and other constants.  The effective depth is defined as the depth which the bubble concentration would be in equilibrium with the dissolved oxygen concentration at an infinite time during the unsteady state oxygen transfer test ($C_{\infty}^{\ast}$).  FaVOr estimates the effective depth for bubble aeration in the AB ($d_e$) as follows (from Baillod et al., 1986) \mb d_e = 0.35 d \mef where $d$ is the tank liquid depth.  $C_{\infty}^{\ast}$ is estimated from an expression found in Baillod {\it et al.} (1986).  It is a function of the effective depth;,barometric pressure, vapor pressure of water, a standard pressure of 101.33 kPa, specific weight of water, and saturation concentration of oxygen.  \underbar{Volatilization}  Volatilization occurs by way of air flow across the AB surface. In an open basin, volatilization is induced by the wind, while in a closed basin volatilization is induced by forced air ventilation.  The rate of volatilization is based on a first-order rate expression where an overall mass transfer rate coefficient ($K_L a$) is multiplied by a VOC concentration driving force: \mb r_{vol} = K_L a ( C - C^{\ast} ) \mef where $r_{vol}$ is the rate of stripping, $C$ is the bulk VOC aqueous phase concentration, and $C^{\ast}$ is the VOC aqueous phase concentration that would be in equilibrium with the bulk air concentration.  The rate expression is based on the existence of a stagnant layer at the wastewater-air interface. When the reactor is uncovered, the air above the basin is assumed to have negligible VOC concentration and $C^{\ast} = 0$.  When the reactor is covered, a VOC gas phase mass balance equation that incorporates a ventilation rate is solved for the VOC gas phase concentration in the stagnant layer.    The overall mass transfer coefficient is based on the liquid and gas phase mass transfer coefficients and the Henry's law constant, assuming that liquid-phase mass transfer resistance is dominant.  The gas and liquid mass transfer coefficients are calculated either from correlations developed by Mackay and Yeun (1983) or by Govind {\it et al.} (1991) and Cohen {\it et al.} (1978). The Mackay and Yeun correlations depend on the wind speed, the gas and liquid phase Schmidt numbers, and the basin depth.  The Govind {\it et al.}/Cohen {\it et al.} correlation is based on a roughness Reynolds number, the VOC liquid diffusivity, VOC molecular weight, wind velocity, and the basin depth.  \underbar{References}  Baillod, C.R., Crittenden, J.C., Mihelcic, J.R., Rogers, T.N., Grady, Jr., C.P.L. 1991.

The feed fractions can be specified only when (a) step feed configuration is enabled and (b) the feed fractions are specified as non-uniform.  The feed fractions must sum to one.   \item{-} whether the CSTR volumes are non-uniform. The default specification is that the CSTR volumes are uniform.  In this case, the user enters a total AB volume and the total volume will be split uniformly over the CSTRs.

In order to enter biomass concentrations for individual CSTRs, the user must specify non-uniform biomass concentrations.    }       \newpage  BIOMASS CALCULATIONS SCREEN  Biomass concentrations are assumed to be equivalent to volatile suspended solids (VSS) concentrations. The biomass concentrations in a single- or multiple-CSTR aeration basin (AB) and the VSS concentrations in the secondary clarifier (SC) wastage and recycle are calculated by solving substrate and biomass mass balance equations.  The substrate is assumed to be equivalent to the BOD$_5$ concentration.  Biodegradation of the VOCs is accounted for in the VOC mass balance equations for the AB and is not accounted for in the substrate mass balance calculations.  The biomass and substrate mass balance equations are based on the assumptions that (a) the system is at steady state, (b) the influent and effluent VSS concentrations are negligible compared to the VSS concentrations in the AB and SC, (c) all biological reactions occur in the AB, and (d) Monod kinetics can be used to describe the kinetics of the substrate and biomass.  The mass balance equations used here are based on those found in Metcalf and Eddy (1979, pp. 418--420 and 430--434).  These equations have been modified to allow for modeling the AB as a series of CSTRs.  The user must specify the following parameters in the Biomass Calculations screen:  {\parindent = 20 pt  \item{-} maximum growth rate constant. This parameter is found in the Monod kinetic expression and ranges from 0.8 to 8 1/day, with a typical value of 3.0 1/day (Metcalf and Eddy, 1979, p. 434).  \item{-} half velocity constant.  This parameter is found in the Monod kinetic expression and ranges from 25 to 100 mg/L BOD$_5$, with a typical value of 60 mg/L BOD$_5$ (Metcalf and Eddy, 1979, p. 434).  \item{-} bacterial decay rate.  This parameter ranges from 0.04 to 0.075 1/day, with a typical value of 0.06 1/day (Metcalf and Eddy, 1979, p. 434).  \item{-} yield coefficient.  This parameter is found in the Monod kinetic expression and ranges from 0.4 to 0.8 mg VSS/mg BOD$_5$, with a typical value of 0.6 mg VSS/mg BOD$_5$ (Metcalf and Eddy, 1979, p. 434).  \item{-} AB influent BOD$_5$ concentration.  The influent BOD$_5$ concentration to the Ab can vary of a wide range, for example, from 50 to 1000 mg/L.  }  Note that all remaining parameters required to solve the mass balance equations have been entered in previous FaVOr screens.  \underbar{References}  Metcalf and Eddy, Inc. 1979. {\it Wastewater Engineering}, McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York.     \newpage  SECONDARY CLARIFIER SCREEN  VOC removal can occur in the secondary clarifiers (SCs) via volatilization and underflow wastage.  It is assumed that the solids are completely removed in the SCs and that biological activity in the SCs can be neglected.  The user must specify the following parameters in the SC screen:  {\parindent = 20 pt  \item{-} the number of parallel SCs in use  \item{-} whether the SCs are covered   \item{-} the ventilation rate for a SC if the SC is covered  \item{-} the liquid depth in a SC  \item{-} the volume of a SC  }  \underbar{Volatilization}  Volatilization occurs by way of air flow across the SC surface. In an open basin, volatilization is induced by the wind, while in a closed basin volatilization is induced by forced air ventilation.  The rate of volatilization is based on a first-order rate expression where an overall mass transfer rate coefficient ($K_L a$) is multiplied by a VOC concentration driving force: \mb r_{vol} = K_L a ( C - C^{\ast} ) \mef where $r_{vol}$ is the rate of stripping, $C$ is the bulk VOC aqueous phase concentration, and $C^{\ast}$ is the VOC aqueous phase concentration that would be in equilibrium with the bulk air concentration.  The rate expression is based on the existence of a stagnant layer at the wastewater-air interface. When the reactor is uncovered, the air above the basin is assumed to have negligible VOC concentration and $C^{\ast} = 0$.  When the reactor is covered, a VOC gas phase mass balance equation that incorporates a ventilation rate is solved to provide the VOC gas phase concentration in the stagnant layer.    The overall mass transfer coefficient is based on the liquid and gas phase mass transfer coefficients and the Henry's law constant, assuming that liquid-phase mass transfer resistance is dominant.  The gas and liquid mass transfer coefficients are calculated either from correlations developed by Mackay and Yeun (1983) or by Govind {\it et al.} (1991) and Cohen {\it et al.} (1978). The Mackay and Yeun correlations depend on the wind speed, the gas and liquid phase Schmidt numbers, and the basin depth.  The Govind {\it et al.}/Cohen {\it et al.} correlation is based on a roughness Reynolds number, the VOC liquid diffusivity, VOC molecular weight, wind velocity, and the basin depth.  \underbar{Wastage/Sorption}  VOCs are removed from the SCs in the underflow wastage in the liquid and solid phases.  The solids concentration in the SC underflow is calculated with a mass balance equation that depends on the SC influent solids concentration, influent flow rate into the SCs, and the SC wastage flow rate, assuming that the solids are completely removed in the SCs.   The rate of removal by VOC sorption to sludge ($r_{sorp}$) in the SCs is given as: \mb r_{sorp} = Q_w ( C + X_w q ) \mef where $Q_w$ is the volumetric wastage rate from the SC underflow, liter/day, $C$ is the bulk VOC aqueous phase concentration, $X_w$ is the fraction of biomass in the SC underflow wastage, mg/liter, and $q$ is the sludge phase concentration of chemical, mg/kg.  Sorption is modeled as an equilibrium process; thus, for low aqueous concentrations of VOCs in a wastestream a linear isotherm can describe the equilibrium sludge phase concentration of the chemical ($q$) with the equilibrium aqueous phase concentration ($C$): \mb q = K_p C \mef where $K_p$ is the chemical specific sludge-water partition coefficient normalized to organic matter (liter/gm VSS or liter/gm TS), and, $C$ is the equilibrium aqueous concentration of organic chemical, mg/liter.  It has been shown that $K_p$ can be estimated from a chemical's octanol-water partition coefficient ($K_{ow}$).  FaVOr allows a user to select either the correlation of Dobbs  {\it et al.} (1989) \mb \log K_p \; \text{(liters/gm VSS)} = 0.58 \log K_{ow} + 1.14 \mef or that of Matter-M\"uller {\it et al.} (1980) \mb \log K_p \; \text{(liters/gm TS)} = 0.67 \log K_{ow} - 2.61 \mef FaVOr accounts for the different units of $K_p$ used in the two correlations.  The correlation of Dobbs {\it et al.} (1989) slightly overestimates sorption while that of Matter-M\"uller (1980) slightly under-predicts sorption (Baker, 1996).  \underbar{References}  Baker, A.L. 1996.

The number of active SCWs is equal to the number of primary clarifiers. The SCW cannot be covered.  The user must specify the following parameters in the SCW screen:  {\parindent = 20 pt  \item{-} whether the SCWs are active   \item{-} the model used to calculate the SCW stripping removal rates: Pool or Nappe  \item{-} the width of the SCWs (the circumference of the SCWs)  \item{-} the distance from the liquid surface at the SCW tops to the liquid surface at the SCW bottoms   \item{-} the rate of gas flow leaving the tailwater of the SCWs (needed for the Pool Model)  }  The VOC is either assumed to be stripped into the air as the liquid flows over the drop, before it contacts the basin water surface, or into the rising, entrained bubbles caused by the turbulence of the water flow entering the receiving basin.  Emission of contaminants at weirs can thus be modeled with two different models: the Pool Model (Baillod  {\it et al.}, 1991) and the Nappe Model (Pincince, 1991).  The Nappe Model assumes plug flow conditions for the liquid and completely mixed conditions for the gas.   All mass transfer is assumed to occur in the liquid stream as it falls to the surface and stripping caused by entrained bubbles in the receiving basin is ignored.  The rate of VOC stripping is related to the rate of oxygen stripping by a diffusivity relationship.  The oxygen stripping rates are calculated from fitted, empirical power law functions based on the width of the SCW and the distance between top and bottom water levels.  The Pool Model assumes plug flow conditions for the gas, completely mixed conditions for the liquid, and considers mass transfer only into the entrained bubbles as they rise through the pool.  Stripping that occurs before the stream contacts the water surface is not considered.  The rate of VOC stripping for the Pool Model also is related to the rate of oxygen stripping by a diffusivity relationship.  The oxygen removal rate is determined by applying a mass balance to the rising bubble. The mass balance equation depends on the oxygen stripping rate, the Henry's law constants for the VOC and oxygen and the ratio of the SCW liquid flow rate to the rate of gas flow leaving the tailwater of the SCW. The oxygen stripping rates are calculated from fitted, empirical power law functions based on the width of the SCW and the distance between top and bottom water levels (Nakasone, 1986).   \underbar{References}  Baillod, C.R., Crittenden, J.C., Mihelcic, J.R., Rogers, T.N., Grady, Jr., C.P.L. 1991.
