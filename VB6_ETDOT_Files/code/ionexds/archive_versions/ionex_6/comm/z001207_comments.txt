Converted open and save process to use Access Database.  

The only existing file that was converted at this point is H_NA_77.iex.  To convert other files, the text file needs
to be printed out and each value put into a record in an Access database.  Some of the lines in the text file
contain multiple values.  H_NA_77.iex can be viewed in Access and used as an example.  Text in the first column 
(field names) MUST be exactly the same as H_NA_77.iex, so copying this file and putting in the new values might
be the best way.  Or re-creating the sample files by using the application, changing the values and saving it 
into the correct name.

Still unresolved:

In the View Kinetic Parameters screen, "In Model, use diffusivity from:" frame, some of the Correlation and 
User Input values calculate differently than what's saved.

The old dll's don't work in this version; they need to be converted to exe's.  In order to view the screens, 
I changed the code that disables the Results screens until after the Run.  Unfortunately, without Running, I don't 
have results data that I can use to test the other screens.

The Graph class was copied into this app, but the code hasn't been changed to use it.  The old graphs didn't 
convert to VB6.

Formula One spreadsheets replaced the old Grid controls on all forms, but without the values created when the 
dll's are run, there was no way to test them.  

When a field value changes, the 'Data Changed' message changes but system doesn't ask to save when the file is closed.
