DESCRIPTION: Batch reactor prediction.

SUMMARY:

I ran Shumin's FORTRAN EXE file and got similar
output to that Shumin got.  Most of the numbers
were off in the third decimal place.  My first
inclination is to consider this deviation unimportant.
I will ask Shumin about it.

ejorun_model.out -- My output.
shuminrun_model.out -- Shumin's output.
