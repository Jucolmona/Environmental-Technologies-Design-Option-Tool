Dave,

Please tell me a time that I can use the computer today. 

I will make a folder G:\luke\adox_for\Forcode\z020627_modified_by_luke (main code) to make the change.  

I will modify the calculation of TIC from alkalinity as CaCO3 eqv mg/L.  The calculation is in the main function adoxtis.f.  It was originally assumed that HCO3- was the predominant TIC species in the water thus TIC~=[HCO3-] and alkalinity was caused only by HCO3-.   As a result, TIC was calculated as  

(alkalinity as CaCO3 eqv mg/L) / eqv weight of CaCO3

However, the above assumption is only correct in a limited pH range.  For general case, the equations below should be used to calculate the TIC. 

[HCO3-] = (Alkalinity+10E(-pH)-10E(pH-14))/(1+2*10E(pH-pKa2))
TIC =  [HCO3-] *(1+10E(pKa1-pH) + 10E(pH-pKa2) )

I will change the TIC calculation to the general case above.
