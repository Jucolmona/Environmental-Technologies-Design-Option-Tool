Dave,

Thanks Dom for his carefulness, he found a bug of AdOx, mainly related to the calculation of TIC from alkalinity.  I need to revise the FORTRAN code on this part.  Could you let me know which computer I can use to do the revision by FORTRAN PowerStation?  It should be less than 30mins.  I will revise based on the FORTRAN code in folder"z000719_modified_by_luke (main code)". Thanks, 

luke
