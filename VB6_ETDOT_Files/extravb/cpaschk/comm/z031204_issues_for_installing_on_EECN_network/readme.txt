  PCs

<x-flowed>
Issues for installing on EECN network (CEE undergrad/grad PC labs):

(1)  Security:  Users have full control over folder where software 
installed (e.g. C:\winapps\etdot10)
(2)  Security:  Users have full control over file C:\windows\MTCHK.LIC
(3)  With regard to the licensing, the DebugMode was previously set to 
true, causing the program to write a file named C:\bug.txt.  I changed the 
DebugMode setting to false to the file c:\bug.txt is NO LONGER WRITTEN.
(4)  With above changes, the program will run for a non-installer, but 
there is still something weird ... when you execute one of the programs, 
before loading the software, it gives the sequence of windows shown in the 
attached ... I think this happened when I installed for Michelle Jarvie and 
Ken was able to fix ...

Next steps:
(a) Ken P. stops by my office and I demonstrate the weird problem in step (4)
(b) Ken P. takes new install CD and installs on master PC, setting 
permissions as described in (1), (2), (3) above
(c) Hokanson logs in and tests the version on install CD as a different 
(non-installer) user and Ken P. resolves the problems of step (4) as needed.

Thanks,
DRH
